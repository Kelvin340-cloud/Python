1) **FARM MANAGEMENT CODE CHALLENGE**

In this code challenge, we assisted a farmer in calculating various financial metrics related to their harvest season. Initially, we computed the total harvest by summing up the yields of wheat and potatoes, providing insight into the overall productivity. Next, we determined the total expenses, considering costs for seeds and labor, highlighting the financial outlay required for farming operations. Subsequently, we calculated the total revenue based on the selling prices of wheat and potatoes per kilogram, reflecting the income generated from the harvested crops. Finally, we computed the total profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total revenue, indicating the financial gain or loss resulting from the farming activities. These calculations, facilitated by basic arithmetic operations and variable assignments, allow for a comprehensive understanding of the farmer's financial performance during the harvest season.


2) **DATA STRUCTURE CODE CHALLENGE**


In these challenges, we aim to create a digital representation of a farm and its equipment using Python data structures. Firstly, we focus on representing a tractor by creating a function that generates a dictionary encapsulating attributes such as model, color, horsepower, and fuel capacity. This provides a structured representation for tractor data, aiding simulation and analysis. Next, we tackle the representation of fields by modifying a nested list to simulate planting rows efficiently, reflecting the progress of planting activities. Finally, we extend this approach to represent all farm vehicles by adding new vehicles to an existing list of dictionaries, allowing for the effective tracking of vehicle attributes and optimization of farm operations. These challenges collectively enable the creation of a digital twin of the farm, facilitating experimentation, analysis, and optimization of agricultural processes in a simulated environment.
